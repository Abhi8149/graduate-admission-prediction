# Graduate Admission Prediction using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Graduate Admission Prediction Model** using **Deep Learning** with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. The model predicts the probability of a student being admitted to a graduate program based on their academic profile and test scores.

## 📌 Features
- Uses **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for prediction.
- Trained on a well-known dataset containing various features like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience.
- Achieves high accuracy through **efficient preprocessing** and **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Provides **predictive insights** to help students evaluate their chances of admission.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **GRE Score** (out of 340)
- **TOEFL Score** (out of 120)
- **University Rating** (1 to 5)
- **Statement of Purpose (SOP)** (1 to 5)
- **Letter of Recommendation (LOR)** (1 to 5)
- **Undergraduate CGPA** (out of 10)
- **Research Experience** (0 or 1)
- **Chance of Admission** (0 to 1)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the neural network
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and evaluation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization
